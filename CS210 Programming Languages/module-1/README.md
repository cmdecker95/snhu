# CS 210 Module One Assignment Guidelines and Rubric

## Overview

This course focuses on the programming language C++, but there are multiple programming languages with their own rules and functional differences. Programmers may develop a preference for one language over another, but there are advantages to understanding the similarities and differences between the various languages and compilers. This assignment requires you to create a basic code in multiple languages, and then to reflect on the differences between them.

## Prompt

For this assignment, you will write a code that outputs "Hello, World!" in C++ and in one other programming language of your choice: Python or Java.

> **Note:** While we recommend using the Virtual Lab to complete this assignment, if you choose to complete this assignment locally, please use the versions of Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, and PyCharm outlined in the syllabus. The SNHU IT Service Desk will be unable to support concerns related to local assignments.

To open the Virtual Lab, go to the Virtual Lab module and click the **Virtual Lab Access** link. Navigate to the Visual Studio IDE. Open the CS 210 folder within the Virtual Lab IDE to access the different programs.

### Task Requirements

1. Create an executable code that reads "Hello, World!" in C++ (Visual Studio) and runs without errors.

   - The Visual Studio Setup Guide may be a helpful resource.
   - Incorporate a header comment with the developer's name, the date, and the purpose of the application.
   - Incorporate in-line comments throughout the code.

2. Create an executable code that reads "Hello, World!" in either Java (Eclipse) or Python (PyCharm) and runs without errors.

   - Incorporate a header comment with the developer's name, the date, and the purpose of the application.
   - Incorporate in-line comments throughout the code.

3. Reflect on the two programming languages:
   - Explain the benefits and drawbacks of using C++ and Visual Studio in a coding project.
   - Explain the benefits and drawbacks of using Java and Eclipse or Python and PyCharm in a coding project.
   - Describe the advantages of being able to code in multiple coding languages and compilers.
     > **Note:** Consider the module resources to answer this question.

## What to Submit

### Program Code

Submit two executable programs as two ZIP files, including all project files that are required to run the programs. Provide screenshots to support your output. Reference the CS Visual Studio Export Tutorial, Downloading Files From Eclipse tutorial, and Zip PyCharm Files Tutorial for guidance on how to download the necessary ZIP folder.

### Programming Languages Reflection

Submit your completed reflection as a one- to two-page Microsoft Word document with 12-point Times New Roman font, double spacing, and one-inch margins. Any sources should be cited according to APA style.
