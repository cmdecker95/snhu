# The Gaming Room - Draw It or Lose It Web Migration

## Project Overview

This repository contains the documentation and implementation for migrating "Draw It or Lose It," an Android game developed by The Gaming Room, to a cross-platform web-based application. The migration strategy employed a server-side Java backend with a modern web frontend to preserve existing code investment while enabling multi-platform deployment.

## Client and Requirements Summary

The Gaming Room is a software client seeking to expand their successful Android game "Draw It or Lose It" to multiple platforms. Rather than developing separate native applications for each operating system, they requested a web-based solution that would work across different devices. The core requirements included:

- Preserving the game's functionality where teams compete to guess rendered images
- Maintaining the singleton design pattern ensuring only one game instance exists in memory
- Supporting multiple teams with multiple players
- Ensuring unique identifiers for games, teams, and players
- Creating a platform-agnostic solution accessible via standard web browsers

## Development Strengths

In developing this documentation, I excelled at creating a comprehensive analysis of the different operating platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile) and their respective advantages and constraints. The evaluation matrix provided clear comparisons across memory management, security features, and compatibility considerations that helped guide architecture decisions. The domain model UML diagram particularly stands out as it effectively visualized the relationships between Game, Team, and Player classes while highlighting the critical singleton implementation.

## Value of the Design Document

Working through the design document before coding was invaluable for understanding the existing architecture before making modifications. By thoroughly documenting the current state, requirements, and constraints, I could clearly visualize the separation between backend and frontend components. This helped identify which parts of the original Android code could be preserved and which needed to be reimplemented for web compatibility. The requirements section kept the development focused on essential features, preventing scope creep and unnecessary complexity.

## Areas for Improvement

If I could revise one section, I would enhance the deployment recommendations with more specific cloud infrastructure details. The current documentation provides high-level guidance about cloud hosting options but lacks specific implementation patterns for scaling the application during peak usage periods. I would improve it by including concrete container orchestration strategies, CDN configuration recommendations, and load balancing approaches tailored to game application patterns.

## Interpreting User Needs

I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on their core business requirement: expanding market reach without duplicating development efforts. This informed the decision to create a platform-independent solution that would work on any device with a modern web browser. Considering user needs is crucial because ultimately the software exists to serve real people with specific goals and pain points. By prioritizing cross-platform accessibility, the application can reach more users while maintaining a consistent experience, directly supporting The Gaming Room's business objectives.

## Design Approach and Future Strategies

My approach to designing this software centered on separating concerns between the presentation layer (frontend) and business logic (backend). By creating clean interfaces between components, we achieved a flexible architecture that could evolve independently on either side. In future projects, I would expand this approach by implementing a more robust API design process using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications from the start. This would facilitate better collaboration between frontend and backend teams while providing clearer documentation for future maintainers. Additionally, I would incorporate more user testing earlier in the development cycle to validate that technical decisions truly address user expectations and needs.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the value of thoughtful software architecture when migrating between platforms. By preserving the core game logic in Java while creating a new web frontend, we delivered a solution that met The Gaming Room's needs for multi-platform support while minimizing development time and risk.
