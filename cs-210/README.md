# CS 210 Portfolio Submission

This repository contains the project files for my CS 210 course project, along with a reflection on the project.

## Project Summary

[Provide a brief summary of the project, including the problem it was solving.]
This project was designed to simulate a cash register and inventory system for a small grocery store. The program takes an input file of grocery items and their prices, allows the user to select items to purchase, calculates the total cost, and updates the inventory.

## What I Did Well

[Describe what you did particularly well in the project.]
I successfully implemented the core functionality of the cash register system, including reading the inventory from a file, displaying the menu of items, allowing the user to select items, calculating the total cost, and updating the inventory. I also implemented error handling to prevent the program from crashing when the user enters invalid input.

## Areas for Enhancement

[Identify areas where you could enhance your code and how these improvements would make your code more efficient, secure, and so on.]
One area for enhancement is to improve the user interface. The current interface is text-based and could be made more user-friendly with a graphical user interface (GUI). Another area for enhancement is to add more features to the cash register system, such as the ability to apply discounts, calculate sales tax, and print receipts.

## Challenges and Solutions

[Describe which pieces of the code you found most challenging to write and how you overcame this. What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?]
The most challenging part of the project was implementing the inventory management system. I had to ensure that the inventory was updated correctly when items were purchased and that the program could handle cases where the inventory was empty. I overcame this challenge by using a map data structure to store the inventory and by implementing error handling to prevent the program from crashing when the inventory is empty.

## Transferable Skills

[What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?]
The skills that I learned in this project, such as file I/O, data structures, and error handling, will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work. I also learned how to design and implement a software system from scratch, which is a valuable skill for any software developer.

## Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

[How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?]
I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using clear and concise code, adding comments to explain the code, and using modular design principles. I also used a consistent coding style throughout the project.
