## Policies

### Course Participation

Course participation is required within the first week of the term for all online courses. Participation in this context is defined as completing one graded assignment during the first week of the course. Otherwise, students will be administratively removed for nonparticipation. Students who do not participate during the first week may forfeit their rights to be reinstated into the course. Students who stop attending a course after the first week and who do not officially withdraw will receive a grade calculated based on all submitted and missed graded assignments for the course. Missed assignments will earn a grade of zero. See the course withdrawal policy and the full attendance policy for further information.

### Late Assignments

Students who need extra time may submit assignments (excluding discussion board postings) up to one week after the assignment due date. Discussion board submissions will not be accepted for credit after the deadline except in extenuating circumstances.

A penalty of 10 percent of the total value of the assignment will be applied to the grade achieved on the late assignment regardless of the day of the week on which the work is submitted.

Students who submit assignments more than one week late will receive a grade of zero on the assignment unless they have made prior arrangements with the instructor.

Students must submit all assignments no later than 11:59 p.m. (in their own time zone) on the last day of the term. No assignments are accepted after the last day of the term unless an incomplete has been submitted. See the incomplete grades policy.

There may be times an instructor makes an exception to the late assignment policy. Instructors may accept late work, including discussion board posts, with or without prior arrangement.

Exceptions to the late policy on these grounds are left to the instructor's discretion, including whether the late penalty is applied or waived. Students should not assume that they will be allowed to submit assignments after the due dates.

If an instructor finds that they are unable to determine whether an exception to the late policy would be appropriate without documentation, the collection and review of student documentation should be handled through the Dispute Resolution team in order to protect the student's privacy. In these cases, students should file a Student Concern Dispute form to have the circumstances reviewed.

If a student is experiencing (or knows they will experience) a circumstance, including pregnancy, that is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Title IX, they are encouraged to contact the Online Accessibility Center (OAC) as soon as possible to explore what academic accommodations might be offered. Instructors must honor all deadlines established through the OAC.
